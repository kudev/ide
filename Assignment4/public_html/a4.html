            The following map shows a heat map based on the number of crimes committed in San Francisco per year. The yearly
            averaged locations of the crimes committed are also displayed.

        <p class="section">Discussion</p>
        <p>
            Our idea was to investigate how the yearly <i>average location</i> changes for the committed crimes. We were hoping
            that we could find some interesting changes, e.g.: surveillance cameras were installed in a district, causing fewer
            crimes to be committed in that area, or an industrial building shutting down, which could attract gangs to it to set
            up a camp there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, our hopes were met with disappointment, as the average location did not change significantly over
            the years. However, this does not mean that our experiment has no results: it shows that the distribution of the
            crimes committed has not really changed in the past 12 years, meaning that there were no parts of the city that
            would get a boost in attention from the police, and neither were there any areas that would lack the attention of
            the justice system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, having just the averages does not mean that the distribution of crimes committed did not change, as it
            would also be possible that the distribution was very different, but the average still happened to be close to
            the other years. Therefore, we created a heat map that would show the number of crimes committed each year on the
            map. By looking at the heat map, we can conclude that the crimes are committed in more or less the same areas.
        </p>
        <p class="section">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            Our experiment has shown that law enforcement in San Francisco is not focusing its efforts on any parts of the
            city.
