        <p class="section">Task 1 - Web server</p>
        <p>
            We chose AwardSpace as our free web server provider. The main site is accessible
            at <a href="http://bgh618.getenjoyment.net/">http://bgh618.getenjoyment.net/</a>,
            which contains a single link to the first assignment. Later assignments will also be available from here.
        </p>
        <p>
            AwardSpace allows us to upload files to them both via their website, as well as FTP.
            The maximum allowed file size is 15 MB, which could <i>potentially</i> lead to difficulties
            if we'll need to upload larger data sets to the web server throughout the course.
            The total disk space available is 1 GB. There is also a limit on the traffic to the website, set to 5 GB.
        </p>

        <p class="section">Task 2 - Images</p>
        <p>
            We implemented this task in two different ways: first by showing a JavaScript-oriented approach
            where we manually position the image at the correct location, and second, where we replace the manual
            calculations by a more CSS-oriented solution.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            Minor comment: although the standard practice is to link to the script files at the very end
            of the body (to allow the website to be displayed without having to wait for the scripts to load),
            we put them in the header as the assignment text said that there should be nothing in the body that
            might indicate that a picture will be loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The picture displayed in the upper right corner is created as an <i>img</i> tag after the document
            has finished loading. Its position (via the <i>right</i> and <i>top</i> CSS properties) was set
            immediately after creation, as well as its positioning set to <i>fixed</i>.
            As applying these rules have a one-time effect, we registered two event handlers for scrolling and
            resizing the window to ensure that the picture always stays in the top right corner. We used
            jQuery to implement this.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the bottom right picture, we created a CSS rule on the class <i>task2</i>, which set the picture
            as the background image for the body, disabled its repeating and set its position to the bottom
            right corner, as well as setting its attachment so that it scrolls with the body. When the document
            was loaded, we used jQuery to set the class on the body.

        <p class="section">Task 3 - Visualisations</p>
        <p class="subsection"><a href="http://scaleofuniverse.com/">Scale of the Universe</a></p>
        <p>
            <b>Positives:</b>
            This page is extremely good at introducing the viewer to the substance of the data -- sizes.
            As everything is visualized in relation to other things and a steady scaling of size, the viewer
            easily grasps the content of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data set is very compact, and even includes text entries about the different objects
            when clicked upon. Very intuitive, and speaks in a language that is easy for most to understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Negatives:</b>
            has some rather unscientific text entries throughout the descriptions,
            and most of the entries are drawn by hand, giving them some inconsistency,
            i.e. the somewhat 'cartoonish' style might not convince all readers.
        </p>

        <p class="subsection"><a href="http://visual.ly/sea-steel">Sea of Steel</a></p>
        <p>
            <b>Positives:</b>
            The Sea of Steel Interactive visualization shows a heatmap of gun confiscations
            in Washington D.C. and the surrounding areas in the USA.
            A heatmap is a great way of presenting concentrations of data, and one of the
            most interesting statistics in this data set is where the concentrated parts of the gun confiscating occurs.
            It is possible to click any part, to see the breakdown of guns confiscated in that area,
            which shows the detail of the data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Negatives:</b>
            The data isn't presented in a particularly compact fashion, and a lot of the key information
            is written below the visualization, making it somewhat difficult to get a clear overview without
            hunting for the various pieces of the data.
        </p>

        <p class="subsection"><a href="http://visual.ly/what-jobs-report-really-means">Jobs report</a></p>
        <p>
            <b>Positives:</b>
            The jobs report visualisation deals with various aspects of the job market in the US,
            as well as other graphs that have to do with the effects of recession. It shows the
            depressions in the economy very well, and gives numbers in a quite good level of detail.
            It also includes a walkthrough of the data which might help people understand what the
            graphs are trying to show.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Negatives:</b>
            The visualisation isn't very free-to-explore (because of the walkthrough), and is mainly a
            narrative which shows the interesting parts, without letting the viewer conclude for themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="subsection"><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Maps</a></p>
        <p>
            Not so much a visualisation of specific data, but a visualisation of data nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Positives:</b>
            Various levels of information: you can look for directions in a specific village,
            but you can also refresh your geography knowledge by zooming out and looking at the global/continental
            level. A lot of the data comes from individuals that help build the database, which keeps it somewhat
            up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Negatives:</b>
            Builds heavily on conventions, but doesn't describe them: figuring out what the different types
            of colours or icons mean is difficult. The community-based approach can also lead to malicious manipulation.
            Unclear language (layers, query features, GPS traces) with no immediate explanation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="section">Task 4 - Individual parts</p>
        <p class="subsection">Erik</p>
        <p>
            I would like to see criminal rates along with the types of crimes commited on the map. The countries would
            be coloured to indicate the crime rates and small pie charts would appear to show the relative frequencies
            between the types of crimes committed. It would also be possible to switch the main colouring of the countries
            to be based on a specific type of crime. The idea would be to identify the 'safe' and 'dangerous' countries/areas
            on the planet. Although charts with crime rates exist, crime rates for the individual crime types are more
            difficult to come by and I could not find any statistics that would combine the different types.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could not find a complete dataset for the entire world, but I did find some country specific statistics. This
            means that the data would have to be gathered individually for every country and most likely normalised. Chances
            are also high that many countries will not have this data available, or not in good enough detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is an example visualisation that illustrates what I have in mind:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src='http://support2.dundas.com/Articles/1093/PieChartOnMap.png' alt='Pie charts on a map'>
        </p>
        <p>
            My version, however, could be navigated. Furthermore, when zooming out, certain countries could be grouped
            together, in which case the pie charts would also reflect the aggregated results for the given area.
