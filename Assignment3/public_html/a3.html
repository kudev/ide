            The following panel contains visualizations of a dataset of 40 hands, with the left panel showing a two 
            dimensional representation of a handprint, and the right panel is a scatterplot for the PCA analysis of the dataset.
            Hovering over the dots in the right diagram will reveal details. Clicking on them will show the associated
            handprint.</p>

        <p class="section">Results</p>
        <p>
            The scatterplot points axes represent the two most dominant (causing the most amount of variance in hands)
            features and the points' position shows how affected the given hand is by that feature (to put it in <i>very</i>
            plain terms). PCA points around the <a class="link" id="link-4">origin</a> (0, 0) represent hands that are very
            close to the 'average' hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the results, it appears that the X-axis indicates the thickness of the fingers and the hand in general,
            i.e. the <a class="link" id="link-30">leftmost hands</a> are generally very slim, whereas the 
            <a class="link" id="link-35">rightmost points</a> have thicker fingers. The Y-axis seems to affect the spread
            of the fingers between the middle and the little finger. <a class="link" id="link-39">Low values</a> on this axis
            indicate that these fingers are very close together, whereas hands with a
            <a class="link" id="link-37">higher value</a> have these three fingers more spread out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visualising principal components on a scatter plot allows correlations to be found easily. It seems that - compared
            to the average - people with thinner fingers tend to prefer keeping them somewhat closer together. Although there is
            not enough data to be able to clearly conlude it, it seems that people with thicker fingers also have a tendency to
            keep them together, although much more so than people with thin fingers. On the other hand, the deviation in the
            case of thick fingers is much higher.
        </p>
        <p class="section">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            There is a great variance in hands, even though the dataset is very small. Having a large amount of features makes
            analysis much more difficult, as it might not even be obvious which features should be investigated. PCA is a
            method to determine the most <i>important</i> (causing the most variance) features, and thus, being able to
            navigate the first few principal components can help to find some quick correlations.

            <li>Erik - Display the datafile row index as a text-label or a tooltip when the mouse hovers over its point in the PCA panel.</li>
            <li>Erik - Connect a piece of text in the discussion with the visualization. For example, when the mouse hovers over the discussion about an outlier, then the outlier gets highlighed in the visualization.</li>
