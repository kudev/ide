            I think it can be very important to be able to see the exact values on various chart, for example when
            one hovers over the line in a line chart, a small tooltip shows the exact value. We did implement this for
            our second chart; hovering over the dots will show the exact temperatures along with the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another very important feature would be filtering. Being able to filter out certain ranges, or being able to
            view multiple data lines (e.g. multiple months for the first chart) can show the subtle differences between
            the individual months, as well as the deviation from the yearly averages.
        </p>

            Furthermore, I sometimes find it particularly useful when an interactive chart allows me to set my own
            <i>'markers'</i>. In terms of a line chart, this would mean that I would be able to set horizontal or vertical
            lines (the markers), so that I can see which values are above or below my threshold.
