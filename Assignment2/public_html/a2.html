            The motivation for this chart was to see how the temperature has changed over the past 140 years in Copenhagen.
            Claims of global warming are certainly widespread enough to warrant some investigation, and this chart aims 
            to check if there seems to be any effect of the global warming in the Danish capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data set was pulled from temperature measurements in
            <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=612061860000&dt=1&ds=14">Copenhagen</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 1880, the average temperature has risen by around 1.5 degrees celsius per year, as is displayed by
            the trend line.<br />
            It is also evident that the year-to-year average temperature has many <i>spikes</i>, as it can vary by
            several degrees.<br />
            Lastly, in the later years of the graph the records for highest average temperature has been set.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gathered results suggests that there is a tendency for the average yearly temperature to increase,
            although on a year-by-year basis, we can have the same average temperature for a year as a hundred years ago,
            i.e. what was called a <i>warm</i> year a hundred years ago would be called cold nowadays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our implementation is relatively straightforward, it follows the same patterns as most resources we found online.
            The trend line implementation was mainly borrowed from a website (credited in the source), but we did modify it
            to suit our needs. We were also experimenting with the various line interpolation techniques to arrive at the
            current, soothingly curving one (e.g. the <i>linear</i> option was very 'spiky').
        </p>

        <p class="section">Chart 2</p>

        <p>
            The motivation for the second graph was to check if there is a correlation in temperatures between
            Egedesminde in Greenland, and Copenhagen, that is, we were curious if the global warming affected the two
            areas in the same way or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data set was taken from the same website for
            <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=612061860000&dt=1&ds=14">Copenhagen</a>
            and <a href='http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=431042200000&dt=1&ds=14'>Egedesminde</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there was a strong correlation between the two temperatures, there would be a roughly diagonal line from
            the bottom left corner (cold in Egedesminde and Copenhagen) to the top right corner (hot in Egedesminde and
            Copenhagen). Instead we get an almost cubic scattering of the data points.<br>
            There are notable outliers in the data, and the biggest difference in temperatures in Egedesminde occur at
            almost the same temperature in Copenhagen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gathered results show that the temperature shifts in Egedesminde and Copenhagen are are not strongly
            correlated, which shows that the world is not uniformly affected by global warming. This is, of course, not
            necessarily surprising given that Copenhagen is a capital and probably generates a lot more carbon-dioxide,
            among other factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scatterplot implementation was mainly written by us based on the scatterplot example in the d3
            <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">gallery</a>. We noticed that when using only the needed
            ranges for the axes, some of the points ended up on the axes themselves, so we extended the ranges by one in all
            directions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think it can be very important to be able to see the exact values on various chart, for example when
            one hovers over the line in a line chart, a small tooltip shows the exact value. We did implement this for
            our second chart; hovering over the dots will show the exact temperatures along with the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another very important feature would be filtering. Being able to filter out certain ranges, or being able to
            view multiple data lines (e.g. multiple months for the first chart) can show the subtle differences between
            the individual months, as well as the deviation from the yearly averages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I sometimes find it particularly useful when an interactive chart allows me to set my own
            <i>'markers'</i>. In terms of a line chart, this would mean that I would be able to set horizontal or vertical
            lines (the markers), so that I can see which values are above or below my threshold.
